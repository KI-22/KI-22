# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
---
I'm Kate (she/her), an aspiring Software Developer currently developing my skills on Makers' Software Engineering Bootcamp (Nov. '24 - May '25). 

The skills I have gained so far in my diverse professional experience (from 5* hospitality to the university sector) have equipped me with an excellent foundation for beginning my career in tech. From problem-solving to clear communication and attention to detail, I look forward to further strengthening (and gaining more!) skills as I progress.
